# ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 EQ
This is an equaliser preset I made for the Thinkpad T14 Gen 1 to make the speakers sound better. This has only been tested on my personal laptop running Linux, and I can't confirm it will work the same way for other ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 models, make any tweaks necessary.

# How to use
## On Windows:
- Disable **ALL** audio enhancements e.g Dolby Audio
- Use software such like [Equalizer APO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/) to load the EQ
- Load loud.txt or quiet.txt, quiet.txt has a quieter overall response but louder bass response, loud.txt has a louder response, but lacks in bass
## On Linux:
- Use software like [easyeffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) to load the EQ
- Load loud.txt or quiet.txt, quiet.txt has a quieter overall response but louder bass response, loud.txt has a louder response, but lacks in bass
